	     <p><a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd">CapsuleCD</a> is made up of a series of scripts/commands that
make it easy for you to package and release a new version of your library artifact (Ruby gem, Npm package, Chef cookbook.. ) while still following best practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bumping <code class="highlighter-rouge">semvar</code> tags</li>
  <li>regenerating any <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.lock</code> files</li>
  <li>validates all dependencies exist and are free of vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>runs unit tests &amp; linters</li>
  <li>uploads versioned artifact to community hosting service (rubygems/supermarket/pypi/etc)</li>
  <li>creating a new git tag</li>
  <li>pushing changes back to source control &amp; creating a release</li>
  <li>and others..</li>
</ul>

<p>While <code class="highlighter-rouge">CapsuleCD</code> <strong>was</strong> a series of scripts, with the release of <strong>v2</strong> that’s no longer the case.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">CapsuleCD</code> has been re-written, and is now available as a <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd/releases">static binary</a>
on <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd/releases/download/v2.0.10/capsulecd-darwin-amd64"><code class="highlighter-rouge">macOS</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd/releases/download/v2.0.10/capsulecd-linux-amd64"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Linux</code></a>
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">Windows</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">NuGet</code> support is hopefully coming soon)</p>

<p>You no longer need to worry that the version of Ruby used by your library &amp; <code class="highlighter-rouge">gemspec</code> is different than the
version required by <code class="highlighter-rouge">CapsuleCD</code>. If you maintain any Python or NodeJS libraries, this also means that a Ruby
runtime for just for CapsuleCD is unnecessary. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">CapsuleCD</code> <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/analogj/capsulecd/tags/">Docker</a>
images for other languages are much slimmer, and based off the standard community images with <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd-docker">minimal changes</a>.</p>

<p>Releasing a new version of your Ruby library hasn’t changed, it’s as easy as downloading the <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd/releases">binary</a> and running:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>CAPSULE_SCM_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=123456789ABCDEF \
CAPSULE_SCM_REPO_FULL_NAME=AnalogJ/gem_analogj_test \
CAPSULE_SCM_PULL_REQUEST=4 \
CAPSULE_RUBYGEMS_API_KEY=ASDF12345F \
capsulecd start --scm github --package_type ruby
</code></pre>

	  <title>15 Lessons in Golang</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Like many developers, I heard a lot of buzz about Golang (or is it Go, I’m still not sure).
In case you’re not familiar with it, it’s an open source language developed by Google.
It mostly caught my interest due to the fact that it’s pitched as a statically typed, compiled modern language.</p>

<p>For a long time that was the extent of my Golang knowledge. I knew I wanted to take a closer look at
it at some point, but I had other priorities. About 4 months ago, I realized the Golang could be the
solution to one of the problems I was facing with <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd">CapsuleCD</a>, my application for generically automating
package releases for any language (npm, cookbooks, gems, pip, jars, etc).</p>

<div class="github-widget" data-repo="AnalogJ/capsulecd"></div>

<p>The problem was that <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd">CapsuleCD</a> was a executable distributed in a Ruby gem, which meant that anyone
who wanted to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">CapsuleCD</code> needed to have a Ruby interpreter installed on their build machine, even
if all they were just trying to do was package a Python library. This made my Docker containers bloated,
and more complicated to develop. Wouldn’t it be nice to just have single binary I could download into the
container? And so the migration to Golang began, if only in my head at that point.</p>

<p>Over the next couple months, I kept going back to that idea, and a couple weeks ago, I finally sat down and
started porting my ~3000 line Ruby application to Golang. While I could have just bought a book like Golang
for Dummies, I decided to just jump into the coding, and just read blog posts and stack overflow when I got stuck.</p>

<p>I can already hear some of you cringing. To be honest, while I was having a lot of fun, my initial development
was pretty slow. I was trying to write an application in a new language, without knowing any of the conventions.
The thing is, I loved it. Those “Ah-Ha!” moments and getting things compiling again after a huge refactor
were an incredible motivator.</p>

<p>Here’s a bunch of the unexpected/unconventional things I learned while porting my app to Golang.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please note, these are things that I didn’t <strong>expect</strong> when I started writing Golang code with a
background in popular typed and dynamically typed languages, (C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Python and NodeJS).
These are not necessarily criticisms of Golang. I was able to go from 0 -&gt; working release of my software
in a completely new language in 2 weeks. That’s pretty awesome if you ask me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="before-your-first-line">Before your first line.</h1>

<h2 id="package-layout">Package Layout</h2>
<p>While not required for a compiled language, I was still unprepared for the fact that there doesn’t seem to be a <strong>Standard™</strong> folder structure for a Golang library, like there is for Ruby, Chef &amp; Node. There seem to be a couple of popular community structures, and I found myself liking <a href="https://peter.bourgon.org/go-best-practices-2016/#repository-structure">Peter Bourgon’s recommendations</a>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>github.com/peterbourgon/foo/
  circle.yml
  Dockerfile
  cmd/
    foosrv/
      main.go
    foocli/
      main.go
  pkg/
    fs/
      fs.go
      fs_test.go
      mock.go
      mock_test.go
    merge/
      merge.go
      merge_test.go
    api/
      api.go
      api_test.go
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="circular-dependencies">!Circular Dependencies</h2>
<p>Package layout becomes even more important when you find out that Golang does’t support circular
dependencies between packages. If A imports B, and B imports A, Golang will give up and complain.
I actually kinda like it, as it forced me to think a bit more about my application’s domain model.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>import cycle not allowed
package github.com/AnalogJ/dep/a
  imports github.com/AnalogJ/dep/b
  imports github.com/AnalogJ/dep/a
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="dependency-management">Dependency management</h2>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">pypi</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundler</code>. Each of these package managers are synonymous with their language. However Golang
doesn’t have an official package manger (<a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">yet</a>). In the meantime the community
has come up with a <a href="https://github.com/Masterminds/glide">couple</a> <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt">of</a>
<a href="https://github.com/kardianos/govendor">good</a> <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt">alternatives</a>. The problem
is that they are all really good, and it can be a bit daunting to pick one. I ended up choosing <a href="https://github.com/Masterminds/glide">Glide</a>,
because it has a similar feel to <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundler</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>This is actually one of the best things about Golang. <code class="highlighter-rouge">go docs</code> and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">godoc.org</code> site are awesome
and standardize the documentation for any library you might use. This is a nice step up from the NodeJS
community where all package documentation is custom and self hosted.</p>

<h2 id="goroot-gopath">GOROOT, GOPATH</h2>
<p>Golang imports are done in a kind of weird way. Unlike most other languages, Golang basically requires
that your source live in pre-configured folder(s). I’m not going to delve into the details, but you should
know that it takes a bit of setup &amp; getting used to. Dmitri Shuralyov’s <a href="https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/blog/18">How I use GOPATH with multiple
workspaces</a> is a great resource.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>GOPATH=/landing/workspace/path:/personal/workspace/path:/corporate/workspace/path
</code></pre>
</div>

<h1 id="scratching-that-itch">Scratching that Itch.</h1>

<h2 id="pseudo-class-struct-inheritance">Pseudo <del>Class</del> Struct Inheritance</h2>
<p>The Golang developers did some interesting things when designing the inheritance model. Instead of using
one of the more conventional inheritance models of typed languages like multiple-inheritance or classical
inheritance, Golang follows a multiple composition pattern similar to Ruby.
<a href="https://github.com/luciotato/golang-notes/blob/master/OOP.md#method-shadowing">Method-Shadowing</a> can
cause some unexpected results if not understood completely.</p>

<h2 id="duck-typed-interfaces">Duck-Typed Interfaces</h2>
<p>This is another cool unexpected feature of Golang. Interfaces are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck-typed</a>,
something I’ve only seen in dynamically typed languages. This duck-typing works hand-in-hand with <code class="highlighter-rouge">struct</code>
composition.</p>

<h2 id="structs-have-fields-interfaces-dont">Structs have fields, Interfaces don’t</h2>
<p>Unfortunately <code class="highlighter-rouge">structs</code> can’t have the same <em>API</em> as <code class="highlighter-rouge">interfaces</code>, as the latter cannot define fields. This
is not a huge issue, as one can just define a getter and a setter method on the interface, but it was a bit
confusing. I’m sure theres a good technical/CS theory answer for why this is, but yeah.</p>

<h2 id="publicprivate-naming">Public/Private naming</h2>
<p>Golang took Python’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">public</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">private</code> method naming scheme one level further. When I initially found
out that functions, methods and struct names starting with an uppercase character are public and lowercase
are private, I wasn’t sure how to feel about it. But honestly, after working with Golang for 2 weeks, I
really like this convention.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>type PublicStructName struct {}
type privateStructName struct {}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="defer">defer</h2>
<p>Another surprisingly useful feature Golang. I’m sure it’s a result of Golang’s parallel processing and
error model, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">defer</code>’s make it really easy to keep your cleanup close to the originating code. Mentally
I treat it like an alternative to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">finally</code> method in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">try-catch-finally</code> pattern or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">using</code>
block in <code class="highlighter-rouge">C#</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">Java</code> but I’m sure there are more creative uses for it.</p>

<h2 id="go-fmt-is-awesome"><code class="highlighter-rouge">go fmt</code> is awesome</h2>
<p>You’ll never have the “tabs vs spaces” debate with a Golang developer. There is a standardized Golang
style and <code class="highlighter-rouge">go fmt</code> can reformat your code to comply with it. It’s a neat tool, and reading its source
introduced me to the powerful <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/parser/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">parser</code></a> and <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ast</code></a> libraries.</p>

<h2 id="goarch-goos-cgo--cross-compiling">GOARCH, GOOS, CGO &amp; Cross Compiling</h2>
<p>My goal of creating a single standalone <code class="highlighter-rouge">CapsuleCD</code> binary is the entire reason I started my port
to Golang. However it quickly became apparent that simple static binaries aren’t an intrinsic feature
of Golang (which should have been obvious). If your code is all written in vanilla Golang, and the code
of all your dependencies (and their dependencies), then you can <a href="http://golangcookbook.com/chapters/running/cross-compiling/">build static binaries</a>
to your heart’s content using <code class="highlighter-rouge">GOOS</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">GOARCH</code>. However if you’re unlucky like I was, and you have
a dependency that calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> code under the hood (by importing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">C pseudo-package</code>) then you’re in for
a world of pain. Don’t get me wrong, creating a dynamically linked binary is still super easy. But to
generate a static binary, with no external dependencies, means you need to ensure that all your
<code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> dependencies (and their dependencies) are all statically linked too. Like I said, obvious.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">C pseudo-packages</code> are compiled via <code class="highlighter-rouge">CGO</code>, and you’ll need to look at the documentation to find all
the compiler flags necessary to help <code class="highlighter-rouge">CGO</code> locate your static libraries. A table of all supported GOOS
and GOARCH pairs is located in the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment">Golang docs</a></p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-test-this">How do I test this?</h1>

<h2 id="hidden-in-plain-sight">Hidden in plain sight</h2>
<p>Test files are suffixed with <code class="highlighter-rouge">_test.go</code> and should be located side-by-side with the code they test,
rather than relegated to a special testing folder. Its nice, even though it feels a bit cluttered at first.</p>

<p>Test data goes in a special <code class="highlighter-rouge">testdata</code> folder. Both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">testdata</code> folder and <code class="highlighter-rouge">_test.go</code> files are completely
ignored by the compiler during <code class="highlighter-rouge">go build</code>.</p>

<h2 id="go-list-and-vendor-folder"><code class="highlighter-rouge">go list</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">vendor</code> folder</h2>
<p>So, dependency management is pretty new to the Golang language, and not all tools understand the special
<code class="highlighter-rouge">vendor</code> folder. As such, when you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">go test</code>, by default you’ll find it running the tests of all your
dependencies. Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">go list | grep -v /vendor</code> to get Golang to ignore the vendor folder.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">go fmt $(go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)</code></p>

<h2 id="if-err--nil"><code class="highlighter-rouge">if err != nil</code></h2>
<p>I’m a stickler for code coverage. I try to keep my open source projects above 80% coverage, but I’m having
a hard time doing that with Golang. Those of you already familiar with Golang will probably just point out that
Golang is one of the easiest languages to get <a href="https://blog.golang.org/cover">good coverage in</a>. Rather
than creating a seperate execution path for errors (<code class="highlighter-rouge">try-catch-finally</code>) Golang treats all errors as standard objects.
Golang convention states that functions which can produce errors should return them as it’s last <code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> argument.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty interesting model, which reminds me a bit of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Node</code>’s built-in functions. However, just like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Node</code>, it can
be difficult to write unit tests that produce errors in built-in functionality. This becomes even more annoying when you follow
a coding pattern where you bubble-up errors, and then handle them at a higher level. When doing this, you’ll write alot of
code the looks like the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>data, err := myfunction(...)
if(err != nil){
	return err
}

data2, err2 := myfunction2(...)
if(err2 != nil){
	return err
}

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This starts to clutter up your code pretty quick. At this point some of you may be thinking that <code class="highlighter-rouge">interface</code>s and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mock</code>s
would solve these problems. While that’s true in some cases, I don’t think it makes sense to write massive <code class="highlighter-rouge">interface</code>s for
built-in libraries like <code class="highlighter-rouge">os</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ioutil</code>, or pass those libraries in as arguments, just so that we can artifically generate
errors for <code class="highlighter-rouge">ioutil.WriteFile</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">os.MkdirAll</code>.</p>

<p>I’m that this is definitely a shortcoming in my mental-model, but I’ve read a ton of documentation and blog posts on how
unit tests and code coverage should be done in Golang, and I still haven’t found a pattern that makes sense without
seeming to require a dependency injection engine of some sort, something that Golang seems to actively dislike as too cumbersome.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts. I’ve only been working with Golang for a few weeks, but it’s been an incredibly educational
and enjoyable experience. I was able to go from no experience to building a real, working application in Golang in very
little time, not just toy examples from some book. I know that I’m no expert in Golang yet, and that there are still  theory gaps
in my understanding of Golang, but I feel like they are much further apart than I expected when I went down this <code class="highlighter-rouge">self-taught without books</code> path.</p>

<p>Golang worked exactly as I thought it would, giving me <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/capsulecd/releases">binaries</a> that I can easily download
onto slim Docker containers, without requiring a Ruby interpreter. If you maintain executables in other languages, I would
definitely recommend you consider giving Golang a try.</p>
